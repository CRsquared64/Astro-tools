Astronomy scripts that are free and easy to use

**Currently Working Scripts:**

## HOO_PREPROCESS:
This script is ment for Dual-Band Ha and OIII filters, to generate a HOO Image.
```
python HOO_PreProcess.py M42_Lxtreme.tiff ProcessedHOO
```
This is the basic formatting for the script, The first Arg is the path to the image you want to use, including the file extenstion. 
The Second arg is the name of the Output, without the file extension. It will deafult to TIFF.
###*this script only works with tiff files*
*atleast for now*
